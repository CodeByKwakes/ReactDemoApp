# ReactDemoApp

Just finished module 5 of "Building Applications with React and Flux" on Pluralsight.

Gulp build that:
-- compiles JSX
-- lints JSX and JS via ESLint
-- bundles JS and CSS files
-- migrates the built app to the dist folder
-- runs a dev webserver
-- opens your browser at the dev URL
-- reloads the browser upon save

```npm install``` - Installs packages
```gulp``` - Builds the project and opens your browser.
